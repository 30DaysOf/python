    "\n",
    "This is the first course in the 5-course specialization on _Python 3 Programming_ from the University Of Michigan. \n",
    "It consists of 4 weeks of content:\n",
    " 1. Welcome to Python Basics\n",
    " 2. Programming in Python\n",
    " 3. Turtle Graphics\n",
    " 4. The Way of the Programmer\n",

    "## Runestone Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "The course uses the [Runestone Academy](https://landing.runestone.academy/computer-science-textbooks.html) platform which provides 3 resources in context:\n",
    "1. The [Foundations Of Python Programming](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/fopp/index.html?mode=browsing) textbook by Prof. Paul Resnick (instructor for this course)\n",
    "2. The [activecode](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/overview/ActiveCode/python.html?mode=browsing) interactive notebook with integrated time-travel (code versioning) \n",
    "3. The [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/)-based \"Code Lens\" feature for visual under-the-hood exploration.\n",
    "3. Additional resources like [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds3/index.html?mode=browsing) for future study.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Study Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "I have 3 objectives for this project:\n",
    " 1. Learn Python3 programming from fundamentals to functional apps (data science, AI)\n",
    " 2. Learn to use Jupyter Notebooks for interactive learning (instead of activecode)\n",
    " 3. Capture study notes as a reusable reference that I can refactor/extend over time\n",
    "\n",
    "While I plan to capture notes and explore problems and exercises from the lectures within Jupyter Notebooks, I will **NOT** be documenting any assignments or solutions from either Coursera or Runestone sources, in keeping with the Honor Code. _If you find any such materials referenced, please file an issue via the repo so I can remove them_."
