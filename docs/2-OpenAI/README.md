## Getting Started

Followed the [quickstart guidance](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/developer-quickstart) which requires an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable setup for use in development environment.

1. Create the key from [this dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (requires project)
1. Copy the `.env.sample` file in repo to `.env`
1. Fill in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable value from 1.

_Note:_ You can also store this as a [Github Codespaces secret](https://github.com/settings/codespaces) and associate it with relevant repos to have the value automatically injected into the runtime environment at launch.
