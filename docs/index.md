# Python Recipes

## Objectives

Learn Python development one recipe at a time, from core concepts to advanced AI. 

## Getting Started

The repo is instrumented with a `devcontainer.json` that should set up all required Visual Code Studio extensions, command-line tooling and Python libraries. Activate the dev container using one of these options:

- **GitHub Codespaces.** This opens a new browser tab with a Visual Studio Code editor.
- **Docker Desktop.** Open VS Code manually and launch dev container with Docker.
    
Each recipe will be contained in a standalone Jupyter notebook or in a subfolder with scripts and a README. Required packages and Visual Studio Code extensions should be pre-installed.
