## Why Python?

There has never been a better time to learn Python (as a beginner) or upskill in Python (as an experienced developer). 
 - It ranks #1 on the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/). This rates programming languages based on usage (lines of code written). 
  - It is general purpose. Use it for data science, automation, web development, testing and more.
  - It is a core skill for AI/ML. Most Large Language Models and Generative AI services release Python SDKs first.

## Learning Goals:
 - Learn Python from core concepts (language) to advanced applications (AI/ML) - with code!
 - Setup and use a consistent and reproducible envirionment (Dev containers, Jupyter Notebooks)
 - Cultivate curiosity in learning without losing focus or context (GitHub Copilot)
