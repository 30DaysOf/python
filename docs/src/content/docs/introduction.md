title: "Python3 In #30Days"
description: What are the Learning Objectives? What is my Development Environment? What is the Roadmap?
---

They say it takes 30 days to create any sustainable habit. I believe this holds true for _learning habits_ as well. It was a core motivation behind the [#30DaysOf](https://github.com/30DaysOf) projects that broke down a key technology into 4 _themed weeks_ of content that helped learners go from core concepts to practical applications in a structured and sustainable way.

With this project, I am building a #30DaysOf roadmap for learning Python3 that has an initial audience of one - myself. I hope to capture my learning journey - with resources used and insights gained - in this website, to help others who may want to pursue a similar journey. In reality, the journey may take more (or less) than 30 days based on your background and interests. _The end goal is to just learn by doing a little every day, for at least 1 month_.



## Why Python?
 - Python ranks #1 on the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) for popular programming languages based on lines of code written. 
 - It is a beginner-friendly language that is also general-purpose, with support for scripting, data science, web development and more. 
 - It is often the first language supported for AI/ML tools, services and SDKs - making it a useful skill to have in the generative AI ecosystem.

## Learning Roadmap

I wanted to start with a structured set of courses or modules that would have an associated community (for support) and a credential (for achievement). So I decided to focus on the [Python 3 Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming) offered by the University Of Michigan, on Coursera.

It consists of these 5 courses _with an estimated completion time of 3 months at 10 hrs/week_. I expect to complete at least 2-of-5 courses in #30Days.

 1. [Python Basics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-basics?specialization=python-3-programming) Course - 34 hours, 4 modules
 1. [Python Functions, Files & Dictionaries](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-functions-files-dictionaries?specialization=python-3-programming) Course - 31 hours, 5 modules
 1. [Data Collection & Processing With Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-collection-processing-python?specialization=python-3-programming) - 16 hours, 3 modules
 1. [Python Classes & Inheritance](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-classes-inheritance?specialization=python-3-programming) - 18 hours, 3 modules
 1. [Python Project: pillow, tesseract, opencv](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project?specialization=python-3-programming) - 21 hours, 3 modules

Once this specialization is complete, I'll continue to add new sections focused on _applied learning_ exploring the usage of Python3 in specific application contexts like **data science**, **generative AI** and **web app development**.


## Development Environment

The first step in my learning journey is to establish a dev environment that is _easy to setup and reproducible across all devices_ so I can work on code from anywhere and collaborate (or debug) with others with the same consistent dev setup. To do this, I will be relying on 4 tools:
 - GitHub Codespaces (and Dev Containers) for the development runtime.
 - Visual Studio Code (and Extensions) for my IDE.
 - GitHub Copilot (and Copilot Chat) for inline assistance.
 - Jupyter Notebooks (with Python Kernel) for interactive exercises.
