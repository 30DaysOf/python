## 01 | Fundamental Concepts

Generative AI has a number of core concepts we need to know more about - like prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, responsible AI, evaluation, LLM Ops etc. Use this section to provide links to _relevant papers, tools and tutorials_ that teach fundamentals.


## 02 | Developer Tools

Building generative AI applications requires tools for building apps, evaluating models, deploying solutions, and orchestrating end-to-end workflows. Use this section to provides links to relevant _libraries, frameworks and platforms_ that generative AI developers should know.


## 03 | Provider Ecosystem

Generative AI applications are driven by _language models_ - both Large Language Models (pre-trained on massive datasets) and Small Language Models (fine-tuned for specialized domains), and variants based on needs e.g., Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs). Use this section to track the growing model providers ecosystem (and relevant models) gaining mindshare with developers. Some examples to start with:

## 04 | Developer Cookbook

This section and the next are focused specifically on _developers_ and capturing tutorials or "recipes" that cover common tasks or workflows in generative AI applications. These should ideally be code-first (snippets) with documentation (what, why) in notebooks.


## 05 | End-to-End Samples

This section captures _real-world applications samples_ that show end-to-end developer workflows from ideation to operationalization, potentially with different platforms (cloud) and providers (model) to get developers a sense or practical challenges and design patterns for production use.
