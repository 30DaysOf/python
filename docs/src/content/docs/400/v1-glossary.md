## F

1. **Fine-tuning** ▫️ The process of training a pre-trained model on a specific dataset to adapt it to a specific task or domain.

## G

1. **Generative AI** ▫️ A class of AI applications that create original content (text, images, audio, code) in response to an input request.

## I 
1. **Inference** ▫️ The process of using a trained model to generate responses to user prompts. This typically involves a deployed endpoint (API).

## L 
1. **LLM** ▫️ Large Language Models that are pre-trained on large amounts of text data and fine-tuned for task-based inference.

## P
1. **Prompt** ▫️ A user request (using natural language) that is fed to a generative AI model to get a relevant response.
1. **Prompt Engineering** ▫️ The process of designing and refining prompts to get relevant responses from a generative AI model.

## T
1. **Task** ▫️ The specific job that the model is expected to perform as a response to prompt. Ex: Text Summarization, Translation, Code Generation etc.
