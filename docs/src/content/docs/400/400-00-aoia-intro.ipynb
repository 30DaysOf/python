They are currently used to drive **generative AI ** applications.\n",
    "1. **Generative AI Applications** - These are AI apps that use LLMs to _generate_ human-like content including text, code, images, and audio. Their ability totake natual language input (\"prompts\") makes them a powerful interface for a wide range of applications from chatbots to code completion.\n",
