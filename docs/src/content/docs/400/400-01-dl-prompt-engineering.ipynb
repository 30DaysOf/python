    "Prompt Engineering is more art than science. Similar to data science (MLOps) lifecycles, we have { idea generation, implementation, evaluation } cycles of iterative development. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Prompt Engineering process is now:\n",
    " - Try something => write a prompt to get a task done\n",
    " - Evaluate response => check if response is what you wanted with a sample input\n",
    " - Iterate prompt => analyze why response was flawed and clarify task in prompt\n",
    " - Repeat evaluate/iterate cycle => get prompt to acceptable state with ONE sample\n",
    " - Extend evaluate/iterate cycle => repeat this with more examples to refine prompt for fairness and consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to have a an **evaluation** process to let us see if changes we make to the prompt are having desired changes to completion quality. \n",
    " - Evaluation can start as a manual interactive process then move towards more evaluation at scale\n",
    " - First = manual evaluation with one target example => iterate till prompt gives me desired response for that example 👉🏽 analogy = teacher grades a student paper (defines grading rubric)\n",
    " - Next = manual evaluation with more target examples => check if refined prompt works with broader set of examples 👉🏽 analogy = teacher grades full class papers (refines grading rubric)\n",
    " - Next = AI-assisted evaluation with more examples => train another AI to check the responses for you 👉🏽 analogy = teacher asks TA to grade class paper (provides grading rubric)\n",
    " - Next = AI-assisted evaluation at scale => use AI to evaluate responses at scale in CI/CD pipelines 👉🏽 analogy = school asks TA org to grade all papers for all teachers  (provides grading rubric for all exams)\n",

The plush is incredibly soft and cute, becoming my daughter's constant companion wherever she goes. However, I did notice a slight asymmetry in the ears, which I believe was not intentional in the design. Additionally, considering the price paid, I found the size to be a bit smaller than expected. There may be larger options available for the same price point. Despite this, I was pleasantly surprised when the plush arrived a day earlier than anticipated, allowing me to enjoy its cuddly features before gifting it to my daughter. Overall, while there are minor flaws, the early delivery and undeniable cuteness of the panda make it a worthwhile purchase."

Yes, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>room. It's worth noting that </span>adults <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>can </span>also <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>like pandas too.  She takes it everywhere with her, and it's super </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>appreciate the charm of pandas. The plush is incredibly </span>soft and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cute.  One of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cute, becoming my daughter's constant companion wherever she goes. However, I did notice a slight asymmetry in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>ears is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>ears, which I believe was not intentional in the design. Additionally, considering the price paid, I found the size to be </span>a bit <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lower </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>smaller </span>than <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the other, and I don't think that was designed to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>expected. There may </span>be <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>asymmetrical. It's a bit small for what I paid for it though. I think there might be other </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>larger </span>options <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that are bigger </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>available </span>for the same <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>price.  It </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>price point. Despite this, I was pleasantly surprised when the plush </span>arrived a day earlier than <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>expected, so I got </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>anticipated, allowing me </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>play with it myself </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enjoy its cuddly features </span>before <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>I gave </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>gifting </span>it to my <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>daughter.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>daughter. Overall, while there are minor flaws, the early delivery and undeniable cuteness of the panda make it a worthwhile purchase.</span>"
