    "Prompt Engineering is more art than science. Similar to data science (MLOps) lifecycles, we have { idea generation, implementation, evaluation } cycles of iterative development. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Prompt Engineering process is now:\n",
    " - Try something => write a prompt to get a task done\n",
    " - Evaluate response => check if response is what you wanted with a sample input\n",
    " - Iterate prompt => analyze why response was flawed and clarify task in prompt\n",
    " - Repeat evaluate/iterate cycle => get prompt to acceptable state with ONE sample\n",
    " - Extend evaluate/iterate cycle => repeat this with more examples to refine prompt for fairness and consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to have a an **evaluation** process to let us see if changes we make to the prompt are having desired changes to completion quality. \n",
    " - Evaluation can start as a manual interactive process then move towards more evaluation at scale\n",
    " - First = manual evaluation with one target example => iterate till prompt gives me desired response for that example 👉🏽 analogy = teacher grades a student paper (defines grading rubric)\n",
    " - Next = manual evaluation with more target examples => check if refined prompt works with broader set of examples 👉🏽 analogy = teacher grades full class papers (refines grading rubric)\n",
    " - Next = AI-assisted evaluation with more examples => train another AI to check the responses for you 👉🏽 analogy = teacher asks TA to grade class paper (provides grading rubric)\n",
    " - Next = AI-assisted evaluation at scale => use AI to evaluate responses at scale in CI/CD pipelines 👉🏽 analogy = school asks TA org to grade all papers for all teachers  (provides grading rubric for all exams)\n",
