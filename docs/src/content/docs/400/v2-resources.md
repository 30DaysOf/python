## Courses To Take

### 1. Deep Learning.AI 

I recommend the [Deep Learning Short Courses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/) for fast, actionable learning of core concepts from industry experts. Each course takes 1 hour, ranging from 100-level (beginner) to 300-level (advanced). Most require only basic Python knowledge - some need advanced experience with libraries like PyTorch that you can pick up as you go. Courses are listed from oldest to newest - older courses may have deprecated content.
