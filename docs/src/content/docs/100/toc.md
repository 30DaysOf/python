:::tip About Lessons

Each Lesson has a Lab and an HTML link. 
- The first is an executable Jupyter notebook for interactive learning. You must open this in Visual Studio Code with a suitable runtime (e.g., GitHub Codespaces). It cannot be viewed in a browser.
- The second is a static HTML version of the notebook suitable for viewing in a browser. To view it within Visual Studio Code use `<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>, <kbd>V</kbd>`.

:::

<!-- 
Use this command to convert a notebook in a folder to HTML and save it in the public folder.
jupyter nbconvert --output-dir ./../../../../public/notebooks --to html <notebook-name.ipynb> 
-->

## Roadmap

For this bucket, I'll start by following the broad outlines of the [Python Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/python) shown below (captured Apr 2024). Please refer to the source for the latest version. Each box has a list of relevant resources that I will use as a starting point.
