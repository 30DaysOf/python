## Resources 
I wanted to start with a structured set of courses or modules that would have an associated community (for support) and a credential (for achievement). So I decided to focus on the [Python 3 Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming) offered by the University Of Michigan, on Coursera.

It consists of these 5 courses _with an estimated completion time of 3 months at 10 hrs/week_. I expect to complete at least 2-of-5 courses in #30Days.

 1. [Python Basics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-basics?specialization=python-3-programming) Course - 34 hours, 4 modules
 1. [Python Functions, Files & Dictionaries](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-functions-files-dictionaries?specialization=python-3-programming) Course - 31 hours, 5 modules
 1. [Data Collection & Processing With Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-collection-processing-python?specialization=python-3-programming) - 16 hours, 3 modules
 1. [Python Classes & Inheritance](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-classes-inheritance?specialization=python-3-programming) - 18 hours, 3 modules
 1. [Python Project: pillow, tesseract, opencv](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project?specialization=python-3-programming) - 21 hours, 3 modules

Once this specialization is complete, I'll continue to add new sections focused on _applied learning_ exploring the usage of Python3 in specific application contexts like **data science**, **generative AI** and **web app development**.
